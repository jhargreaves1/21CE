           Each player has three pieces. The winner is the first player to align their three pieces on a line drawn on the board.
            The board is empty to begin the game, and players take turns placing their pieces on empty intersections. Once all pieces are placed (assuming
            there is no winner by then), play proceeds with each player moving one of their pieces per turn. A piece may move to any adjacent vacant  
			point on the board.<br />
            The earliest known board for the game includes diagonal lines and was "cut into the roofing slabs of the temple at Kurna in Egypt" c. 1400 BCE<br />
